# GAIN STAGING

# GLOSSARY

__Gain staging__ is also known as gain structure; the process of matching the output level of one piece of equipment or software to the input of the next. It's important to avoid distortion, maximise signal-to-noise ration and achieve the best sound, this is usually a question of compromise and finding a balance between all stages of the signal chain.
