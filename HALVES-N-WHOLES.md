# Half Steps and Whole Steps in Keys

Semi-tones and whole-tones are used for synthesizers. We can also refer to these notes on the piano with a slightly different term. Half-steps and whole-steps.

The distance of a half-step is the smallest amount of space between two notes.

The distance of a whole step is two half steps.

So in a piano roll editor, two notes that are right on top of each other are half steps. The two notes with a space in-between are whole-steps.

We can learn how to find any key through a pattern of whole steps and half steps that make up the scale, which tell us all the notes in the key.
