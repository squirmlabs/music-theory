The Elements of a key
====================

A Key is a pattern of notes that work together. While there are 12 possible notes you can play
in a single octave, only eight of those notes are in key and therefore are the best notes to use.

A Scale is an arrangement of all the notes in a key. The key it'self just tells us what notes will sound good together, a scale is all of those notes in a given order: either from low to high or high to low.

A Chord is a smaller grouping of notes within a key. Chords usually have three of four notes in them, all of which will be in key(if our chord progression fit's entirely in the key, which is an option we have.) A chord is made of notes in key that sound especially good together. So while all notes in a key sound relatively good together, the notes in the chord work really well when grouped.

Keys are all the notes that sound good together. Scales are all the notes in a key in order, and chords are smaller groupings of notes that sound especially good together.

The Pattern of a Key
====================

There are a few things to memorize when it comes to music theory.

__You can find any key by starting on a root, and applying a pattern.__

The Root
----------------------

The __root__ is the note that the key is named after. The __root__ of the key of `C Major` is the pitch `C`. The __root__ of the `C Major` scale is the pitch `C`. The __root__ of a `C Major` chord is the pitch `C`. The __root__ is always a single note.

__After we have the root, we can apply a pattern made of half-steps and whole-steps.__

### The Major Scale Pattern

Major Scales and Major Keys
====================

There are two main types of scales and keys: Major and Minor. With the use of an analogy, we can think of these like two different flavors of ice cream. Ice cream being the scale and key, you may want chocolate ice cream. You could be served chocolate with peanuts as your topping, or you could be served with chocolate with raspberries as your topping. Both servings are still considered chocolate ice cream. When it comes to taste, the taste would be very different between the two servings.

Let's focus on the Major Scale and Keys. It's important to note that this doesn't include chords. Even though, we are focused on the Major Scale and Key, we still have major and minor chords that can be played.

## Scale Degrees

__The `Scale Degree` is a term referring to the relationship between a note and a root.__


| C Major       | Degree  |
| ------------- |:-------:|
| D             | 2       |
| E             | 3       |
| F             | 4       |
| G             | 5       |
| A             | 6       |
| B             | 7       |

> In C major scale, the pitch `D` is scale degree 2. `D` is the second note of the scale. 
> In C major scale, the pitch `E` is scale degree 3. `E` is the third note of the scale. 
> In C major scale, the pitch `F` is scale degree 4. `F` is the forth note of the scale. 
> In C major scale, the pitch `G` is scale degree 5. `G` is the fifth note of the scale. 
> In C major scale, the pitch `A` is scale degree 6. `A` is the sixth note of the scale. 
> In C major scale, the pitch `B` is scale degree 7. `B` is the seventh note of the scale.
