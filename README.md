The Elements of a key
====================

A Key is a pattern of notes that work together. While there are 12 possible notes you can play
in a single octave, only eight of those notes are in key and therefore are the best notes to use.

A Scale is an arrangement of all the notes in a key. The key it'self just tells us what notes will sound good together, a scale is all of those notes in a given order: either from low to high or high to low.

A Chord is a smaller grouping of notes within a key. Chords usually have three of four notes in them, all of which will be in key(if our chord progression fit's entirely in the key, which is an option we have.) A chord is made of notes in key that sound especially good together. So while all notes in a key sound relatively good together, the notes in the chord work really well when grouped.

Keys are all the notes that sound good together. Scales are all the notes in a key in order, and chords are smaller groupings of notes that sound especially good together.

The Pattern of a Key
====================

There are a few things to memorize when it comes to music theory.

__You can find any key by starting on a root, and applying a pattern.__

The Root
----------------------

The __root__ is the note that the key is named after. The __root__ of the key of `C Major` is the pitch `C`. The __root__ of the `C Major` scale is the pitch `C`. The __root__ of a `C Major` chord is the pitch `C`. The __root__ is always a single note.

__After we have the root, we can apply a pattern made of half-steps and whole-steps.__
